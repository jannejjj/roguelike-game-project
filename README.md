A simple Unity game for a university course, I might keep working on it after the course ends.

For the terrain assets I used the Mystic Woods asset pack by Game Endeavor, colors slightly modified: https://game-endeavor.itch.io/mystic-woods .

The background music is from: https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-music/downloads-c/8-bit-music/6

Sound effects and art other than the terrain are self-made.

The game is running at: https://jannejjj.itch.io/sword-guy (unless it's not)
